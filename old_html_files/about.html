        <p> ProConnect offers its users different ways of customizing their respective pages in order to present themselves
          to companies/employers. ProConnect allows users to showcase their experience, skills, education, projects, and resume in
          a well organized and customizable manner. In addition, employers will be able to search for users that obtain an employer’s
          desired qualities, which includes work style. For this to be done, ProConnect implements several query searching and filtering
          algorithms. For example, if a company looking to hire a software engineer needs a software engineer that is strong in the Java
          programming language, that company will be able to find user’s that are Java fluent through filtering features. Additionally,
          when an employer intends to search for those that are detailed-oriented, data-oriented, ideation-oriented or emotionally-oriented,
          as is described by Tate in the article “How To Recognize And Manage Different Work Styles,” there will be a filter feature available
          to exhibit those that display a chosen style.
